- Feature 1 = ....
- Feature 2 = ....

## Explain the objectif of the analysis

Given input data about a patient, the goal is to predict the LOS ( Lenght of Stay ) of the patient in the hospital.

> This parameter helps hospitals to identify patients of high LOS risk (patients who will stay longer) at the time of admission. Once identified, patients with high > LOS risk can have their treatment plan optimized to miminize LOS and lower the chance of staff/visitor infection. Also, prior knowledge of LOS can aid in
> logistics such as room and bed allocation planning.





## Input Analysis and Transformation

- Transform some inputs to be usable

## How to Use the data ?

- We have 318438 samples, this is a lot. Use minibatch ?
